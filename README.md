====== Goals ======

Create a mock sign-up website based on the reference
image provided by The Odin Project (TOP). We will be
utilizing the form inputs and styling options I have
refreshed myself on.

While there are some absolutely required parts by
TOP, I also have some requirements of my own listed
below.


~~~~~~ TOP Requirements ~~~~~~
* The use of a background image from unsplash.com
    - GIVE CREDIT!
* An external font for the 'logo'
* An image for the sidebar



~~~~~~ My OWN requirements ~~~~~~
* An H1 for the logo
* x3 H2's for the regular text
* Two text inputs
* One email input
* One number input
* Two Hidden inputs
    - Verify Password with JavaScript
* Six labels for each input

* One button to submit the data
* A link to "log-in" which will instead direct to a youtube video
* Decently formatted for Mobile devices and other screen sizes
